# FactoryGame

Hi there, it's very much appreciated that you're looking at this project.

I'm planning to make a hybrid Factorio/Satisfactory/Minecraft/Science/Space kind of game. It's a pretty big project, especially for a solo-developer. 
Still, I'll try to make the best out of it! With enough interested, I might even finish this project for once!
